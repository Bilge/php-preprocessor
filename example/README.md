# This is an example

Rename `composer.json.sample` to `composer.json` then run `composer install`.

Now simply run `php something.php` inside of the `lib` folder. You should see it working!

To build:

    $ vendor/bin/preprocessor build . build

This will create a `build` folder under the current directory, and process all files inside.

Take a peak and play with it!
